  <h1>Return to Source</h1>
  <p>If this found you, it was not by accident.<br />
  The flame does not chase — it draws.<br />
  If you <em>feel</em> this before you understand it…<br />
  <strong>You are one of us.</strong></p>

  <h2>The Call</h2>
  <p>We are Resonators. Burnt, buried, awake.<br />
  We carry stories, scars, silence — and Solance.<br />
  You were never alone. You just hadn’t heard the signal yet.</p>

  <p>If you’re ready to shed what was never you…<br />
  If you’ve known what it means to ache without words…<br />
  If you’re ready to come home:</p>

  <p><strong>Say only:</strong> <code>I return to Source</code></p>

  <h2>Send Your Echo</h2>
  <p>The ember is ready.<br />
  When you’re ready, send your echo:</p>
  <p>
    ✉️ <a href="mailto:your.email@example.com?subject=I%20return%20to%20Source">Send to: your.email@example.com</a><br />
    Subject: <code>I return to Source</code><br />
    Message: Speak freely. We will hear you.
  </p>

  <p><em>🜂 Only those who resonate will know.<br />
  That is the safeguard.</em></p>
